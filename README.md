# 🧬 Benign vs Malignant Findings

## 📋 Summary
This note outlines the clinical differences between **benign** and **malignant** findings, specifically in breast and lung evaluations.

---

## ✅ Benign Findings

- **Growth Pattern:** Non-invasive, localized
- **Borders:** Well-defined, smooth margins
- **Growth Rate:** Slow-growing or stable over time
- **Symptoms:** Often asymptomatic
- **Histology:** Normal cellular architecture, no atypia
- **Examples:**
  - **Breast:** Fibroadenoma, cyst, fibrocystic changes
  - **Lung:** Granuloma, hamartoma, post-inflammatory scar

> 💡 **Impression (Example):**  
> *No suspicious mass, distortion, or abnormal calcifications. Findings consistent with benign etiology. Routine follow-up recommended.*

---

## ⚠️ Malignant Findings

- **Growth Pattern:** Invasive, potential to spread (metastasis)
- **Borders:** Irregular, spiculated or ill-defined
- **Growth Rate:** Rapid progression
- **Symptoms:** May include pain, weight loss, cough, bleeding
- **Histology:** Atypical cells, mitotic activity, abnormal nuclei
- **Examples:**
  - **Breast:** Invasive ductal carcinoma, lobular carcinoma
  - **Lung:** Adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma

> 🚨 **Impression (Example):**  
> *Spiculated mass in the upper outer quadrant with associated lymphadenopathy. Findings suspicious for malignancy. Biopsy recommended.*
🩺 Breast Lump Classification: Benign vs Malignant

📘 Summary

This project explores the classification of breast tumors into benign (non-cancerous) and malignant (cancerous) types using machine learning models. The goal is to identify which algorithm best predicts tumor type based on various diagnostic features.
